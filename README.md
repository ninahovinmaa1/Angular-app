## To run backend, navigate to json-server folder and run:
`json-server --watch db.json -d 2000`
This will set up a static light weight backend server that listens to changes in db.json and simulates a 2 second delay in responses ( -d 2000).  

## To run frontend, navigate to Angular-app folder and run ng serve. Navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the app.
